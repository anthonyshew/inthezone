Not every organization has the same amount of teams. Let's make sure you have a page for each one of yours.

### Creating a New Team

To create a new team, visit the "Teams" collection, and look near the top center of the page for the "New Teams" button. Clicking this button will give you a brand new team to edit. On your website, you will have a new page for this team.

### Deleting a Team

Every team retires at some point. To delete a team from your system, open the "Teams" collection and click on the team that you would like to delete.

You will now be on that team's Content Editor page. In the top left of your screen, you will find a red "Delete Entry" button. Clicking on this button will delete your team forever! So, **be careful**, all of the data for this team will be lost forever and, if you want this team back, you will have to recreate it from scratch.
