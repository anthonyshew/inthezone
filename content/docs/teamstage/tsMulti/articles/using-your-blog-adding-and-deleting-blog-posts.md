### Creating a New Blog Post

To create a new blog post, visit the "Blog" collection, and look near the top center of the page for the "New Blog" button. Clicking this button will give you a brand new blog post to edit.

### Deleting a Blog Post

At some point, you might not need or want your blog post anymore. To delete a post from your system, open the "Blog" collection and click on the post that you would like to delete.

You will now be on that blog post's Content Editor page. In the top left of your screen, you will find a red "Delete Entry" button. Clicking on this button will delete your blog post forever! So, **be careful**, all of the data for this post will be lost forever and, if you want this post back, you will have to recreate it from scratch.
