The people that make up your team are what make them great. Let's make sure the place dedicated to them on your site is awesome.

### Adding Your First Coach

To add a coach, head to the team you want to add a coach for and find the "Coaches" section. Click the "Add coach" button. Provide the required information for your coach and he'll be displayed on your website.

### Adding Your First Player

To add a player, head to the team you want to add the player for and find the "Players" sectiojn. Clic the "Add player" button. Provide all of the required information for your player and he'll show up on your website. A few things to note:

* If you provide a picture for the player but leave the "Use Player Headshot?" toggle turned off, we will use a generic placeholder for the player.
* If you turn the "Use Player Headshot?" toggle on but don't provide a picture, we will still use the placeholder.

### Do you want to use Player Stats?

We realize that there is a lot to fill in if you want to post stats for every player. For that reason, we give you a toggle to show or hide stats above the "Players" section. If you don't want to show player stats, keep this turned off. However, if you want to make sure the players can find their stats online like the Big Leagues, turn this toggle on!
