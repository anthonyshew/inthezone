A group of images in a slider is a really nice way to create a visual experience for your fans, players, coaches, and parents. A group of images from last night's game, last weekend's tourney, or a fun event with the players can be saved for memories!

### The Image List

After giving your gallery event a name and date, you'll want to add the images to the gallery for the visuals your web visitors came to see!

* To add a new image to the list, click the "Add Image" button and upload your image.
* Upload your images just as you would anywhere else in your Content Editor. Don't worry; they don't need to be the same sizes, shapes, or resolutions. We'll take care of that for you!
* The first image in the list will be the one that is used as the featured image for the gallery. So, whichever image you want to show up as the cover, make sure that one is first in the list!
