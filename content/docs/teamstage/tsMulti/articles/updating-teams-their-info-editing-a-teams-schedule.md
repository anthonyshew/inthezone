### Weekly Practice Scheduling

If this team has a **consistent, repeating practice schedule**, you can write down their practice schedule once and not have to come back to the Content Editor until the schedule changes at some point in the future.

To set up a weekly practice schedule, open the "Schedule" section of the team and click the "Add Weekly Practice" button. Select the day of the week that this practice will happen on, give it an address, and enter the start and end time for the practice. The practice will now show as a weekly practice that happens every week.

### Upcoming Practices

To schedule a **one-time practice**, create it using the "Upcoming Practices" list. Click on the "Schedule" section of the team and click the "Add Upcoming Practice" button. Give the practice it's required information and it will be added to the schedule.

### Upcoming Games

To add a game to your schedule, visit the "Schedule" section of the team and click the "Add Upcoming Game" button. Fill in the information for the game and it will be added to your schedule.
