We have crafted your Content Editor to be as simple to use as possible. Here, we will explain the various pieces of the puzzle - just in case something isn't as easy as we hope it is!

### Always make sure you publish!

You can make all sorts of edits but never have them go live on your site if you don't publish them! If you have unsaved changes, your Content Editor will tell you in the top left of your screen - and it will warn you if you try to navigate away from the page without saving first.

**To save your changes, click publish in the top left corner of your screen. Then, click "Publish now" when it drops down. Your changes are now safely saved.**

### About Collections

*Collections* are like "folders" or "sections" of your Content Editor. They're just a way that we organized the information for you in a way that makes sense. There are two types of collections.

#### Folder Collections

A *folder collection* is a collection where you can add and subtract files. If you are in a folder collection, you will see the button to add a new file near the top of the screen (above the list of files currently in the collection). You'll also find a delete button at the top of the screen when you have a file opened. So, in a folder collection, you'll be able to create, delete, and edit the types of content that are of the same type.

Depending on what the collection is representing, these files might be blog posts, news articles, teams, a gallery of photos or something else. In this way, you can create a list of blog posts, for instance.

#### File Collections

A *folder collection* is a collection where you can't edit the amount of files that are in the collection. We create the files and its structure on our end and you get to edit the content of it. You won't find any buttons to create new files or delete existing ones. Of course, you will still be able to edit existing files.

This is useful for when we need to get a certain piece of information from you that won't be something that won't be repeating. For example, the name of your organization, your contact email, or a social media account handle. We just need it once and you're good!

### Input Types

Where you will be inputting information into your Content Editor, you'll be using what are called *inputs*. An input, as you can imagine, is a place where you can "input" information. Of course, there are various types of inputs and information out there so let's explore the types of inputs you will find in your Content Editor.

#### Rich Text Input

A *rich text input* is what is used to create the most complex pieces of custom functionality on your site. A rich text input allows you to combine paragraphs, headings, bold, italics, links, images, and more to build a blog post, a custom page, or any other highly customized area where you want the freedom to create what you want.

In a rich text input, you get a toolbar of buttons that allow you to create the various types of content that make a rich text area so great. Here is a description for the buttons in your toolbar:

* Bold: **Bold some text for greater emphasis!**
* Italics: *Italicize your text for greater emphasis.*
* Link: To create a link, highlight the text that you want to become a link. Now, click on the link button and enter a valid URL.
* Headings: Headings are important for giving your rich text area some hierarchy. Your headings will become larger and bolder than the rest of the text, depending on which heading you used.
* Quote: Quotes will be specially styled on your live site to give them some extra emphasis. They will come out stylized to give the quote some extra flavor for your site visitor. These work great for quoting players, coaches, parents, and anyone else!
* Bulleted List: A bulleted list can be a good way of making information easy to read if it is a list of items with no particular order.
* Numbered List: A numbered list is great for a list of items that needs some order.
* Image: Insert an image with this button. You'll be taken to the Image Picker (see below for more information) where you can select an image and create alt text for it. (Alt text is important! [All about alt text.](https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text)).

#### Text Input

A *text input* is simply an input where you can provide any simple text needed to put on your site. In a text input, you can type letters, numbers, and any other characters you'd like! Any text will do!

#### Number Input

A *number input* is a place where you can only type numbers. Depending on if it makes sense for the number, you may or may not be able to use decimals. For instance, the "win" stat doesn't need a decimal place but the "batting average" stat will.

#### Date Input

A *date input* allows you to input a date and time into the system. Click on the box where the date and time is currently showing and you will receive a calendar view.

* To change the selected day, click on a new day for that month.
* To change the month, click on the month itself or use the arrows to scroll through the year.
* To change the year, click on the month and then again on the year to select a new year.
* To change the time, click the currently selected time and then use the arrows to adjust the time to your desire.

#### Image Input

An *image input* allows you to upload images to the system to show on your page. When you want to add or edit an image, you'll use the *Image Picker*. The *Image Picker* is a new view that will pop up and you'll notice several options to choose from:

* Choose Selected: To pick out an image to use on your site, click it's thumbnail and click "Choose Selected." Now, your image is ready to get used! If you don't see any image thumbnails to select, it is because you need to upload one first (see below).
* Delete Selected: You are allowed to delete an image from your system if you'd like. Click the image's thumbnail and then click "Delete Selected" and it will be gone from your system." **But be careful!** If the image was used somewhere else on your site, you'll break the system and won't be able to make new edits until this error is corrected. Maybe it is just best to leave that image there unless you are sure. :)
* Upload: Click this Upload button and you will be prompted to add a new image to your system. Acceptable formats are jpg, jpeg, webp, gif, png, bmp, tiff, and svg.
* Download: If you want to download one of the images currently in your website's system, select it's thumbnail and click download.

#### List Input

A *list input* allows you to create a (you guessed it!) a list that is however long you need to of a repeating item. Inside of the list, we will provide you with an item that has its own inputs to fill in. There are three important parts that you will find in list inputs:

* The "Add new ..." Button - This button allows you to create a new item in your list.
* The Arrow on the Left - This button opens and closes the list so that you can see what is in it - or hide it quickly if you want to un-clutter your screen.
* The List Items - Depending on the purpose of the list, the items in the list will be different. If the list being made for the team's upcoming games, the list item will be structured to suit that. If the list is for a set of images, the inputs will change accordingly.

#### Color Input

A *color input* is a place where you can select a color to use throughout your site. In our case, this will set the color scheme for your team's site.

To use the color input, click the color you would like to change. This will open the *Color Picker* which has some unique functionality:

* To select a new color hue, use the horizontal bar, to change from red to green to purple to any color in between!
* Now that you have selected a hue, you may select the right shade by clicking in the box showing the various shades and dragging until you find your desired overall color.
* If you are familiar with RGB, HSL, or hexcodes for colors, you may also use the inputs in the bottom of the Color Picker to achieve your desired color.

#### Toggle Input

A toggle *input* looks a lot like a switch that you can turn on and off. In your system, you won't find many of them. However, when you do, you can think of them as a lightswitch that turns something on and off.
