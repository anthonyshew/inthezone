### Your Contact Email

Your site contains a contact form that will send you an email when people fill it in and submit.  Make sure that you provide a valid email address that you check often in the "Contact Email" input so that you can receive their messages! The form will not work until you provide an email address.

### Your Phone Number

The phone number that you provide is only for display purposes. It will show in various places on your website so that people know where they can reach you.

### Your Street Address

Similar to your phone number, the street address that you provide is for display purposes only. Your site visitors will now know where they can find your organization!
