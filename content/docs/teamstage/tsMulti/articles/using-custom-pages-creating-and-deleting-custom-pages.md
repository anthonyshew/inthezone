Custom pages allow you to add a page to your website for just about anything. You can have none, one, or as many as you'd like!

### Creating a New Custom Page

To create a new custom page, visit the "Custom Pages" collection, and look near the top center of the page for the "New Custom Pages" button. Clicking this button will give you a brand new custom page to edit.

### Deleting a Custom Page

At some point, you might not need or want your custom page anymore. To delete a page from your system, open the "Custom Pages" collection and click on the page that you would like to delete.

You will now be on that custom page's Content Editor page. In the top left of your screen, you will find a red "Delete Entry" button. Clicking on this button will delete your custom page forever! So, **be careful**, all of the data for this page will be lost forever and, if you want this page back, you will have to recreate it from scratch.
