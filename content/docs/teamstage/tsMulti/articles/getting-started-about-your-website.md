### What is a Content Editor?

Your *Content Editor* is the place on your site where you can create changes and customize your website. We may also refer to it is your *Admin Panel*. Inside of your content editor, you can create, edit, update, and delete the various sections of your site to make it perfect for your organization.

### Creating an account

To create an account for you on your TeamStage site, there are two easy steps.

1. You'll provide us with the email address that you want to use to login. Once we have your email address, we will add it to your system.
2. You'll receive an invite link in your email's inbox. Click on the link and you'll be taken to your TeamStage site where you will be asked to create a password.
3. Login and use your Content Editor!

You won't be able to create new accounts on your own. To create more users, you'll [contact us](https://inthezone.dev/#contact-form) like before so that we can make an account for you. As a security feature, we set things up so that we are the only ones able to create an administrator account on your website.

### Logging into your Content Editor

To log in, you will want to visit the "*/admin*" page on your website. If your website's domain is "https://www.exampleteam.com", then you will find your Content Editor at "https://www.exampleteam.com/admin". Just like visiting any other page on the web but this one is just for you!

You won't find links to it on your main page and regular visitors to your website won't know about your Content Editor. They never see a link to this page or even know it exists. Only you will!
