### Tell Us Who You Are

Opening up the "Organization Info" collection, you'll find a group of inputs to fill out. In this section, we'll discuss the ones that are text inputs. They are as follows:

* Organization Name: The large title that all of your teams play under. This name will show up in the header of your site's pages and becomes the over-arching name that your teams and site will go by.
* Hometown: This town will get used anywhere that the home base for your organization gets shown.
* Contact Info & Street Address:

  The contact email in this section will be used by your contact form for any messages that someone wants to write to you. Make sure you write down an email that you check consistently!

  The phone number input will show in the footer of the website. Make sure that you give it the formatting that you desire so that it looks nice on your pages! Include dashes and parantheses as desired.

  The address inputs operate as one would expect. Be certain that this address is correct as it is likely that your site visitors will use this to try to find your establishment, if you have one.
* Social Media Accounts: If you have social media accounts to show off for your organization, you may list them in their respective inputs. Make sure to use the complete and correct URL so that when someone clicks on the Twitter logo on your site, for example, they do really end up your Twitter page!
