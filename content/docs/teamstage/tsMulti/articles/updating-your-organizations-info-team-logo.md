### Prepared for Success!

There are three main characteristics of your logo image that will make it look awesome on your site:

1. #### Transparent Background

   If your logo's background is not transparent, you will end up with an ugly rectangle around it! Don't have a copy of it without a background? [This site lets you upload your image and it will remove it's a background for you.](https://remove.bg) If you still need help, feel free to [contact us](https://inthezone.dev/#contact-form).
2. #### Square Dimensions (Or Close)

   The more square your logo is, the larger it will show up on your website. The logo only has so much real estate that it can take up on the page so, if it is too wide, for instance, it will end up very small and hard to see.
3. ### High Quality

   If the image you upload is of poor quality, it will end up poor quality on your website, too. The better the resolution, the better it will look!
