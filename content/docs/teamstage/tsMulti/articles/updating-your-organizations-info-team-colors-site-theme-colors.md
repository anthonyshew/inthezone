### Your Site, Your Colors

It wouldn't be an awesome website for your organization without displaying the right colors!

To get the right colors on your site, open the "Organization Info" collection and click on the "Basic Info" file.

Here, you will find a section called "Colors". Once you have it opened, you'll get to see three colored bars. Using the Color Pickers, you can breathe the life of your organization into your website.

### Having trouble?

It's possible that your colors might not work out perfectly if they are too similar (two dark colors, three light colors, etc.). You could end up with dark text on a dark background that makes things unreadable, for instance. If this is the case, feel free to [contact us](https://inthezone.dev/#contact-form) so that we can clean up your configuration to work with your colors better.
