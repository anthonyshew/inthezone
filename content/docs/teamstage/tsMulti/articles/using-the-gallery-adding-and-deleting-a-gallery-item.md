In the gallery, we have created a place where you can show off photos as groups of events or categories. This is a great way to show of some visuals of your organization!

### Creating a New Gallery Event

To create a new gallery Event, visit the "Gallery" collection, and look near the top center of the page for the "New Gallery" button. Clicking this button will give you a brand new gallery to edit.

### Deleting a Gallery Event

At some point, you might not need or want your gallery event anymore. To delete a gallery from your system, open the "Gallery" collection and click on the post that you would like to delete.

You will now be on that gallery's Content Editor page. In the top left of your screen, you will find a red "Delete Entry" button. Clicking on this button will delete your gallery event forever! So, **be careful**, all of the data for this gallery will be lost forever and, if you want this gallery back, you will have to recreate it from scratch.
