### Title & Description

The easiest way to get your site visitor to read your blog post is with a great title and description! Do your best to have these be attention grabbing lines of text that make your visitor want to know more.

### Publish Date

By default, your blog post will get assigned the date and time for the moment you publish it.

If you want to change the publish date, feel free to do so. However, do keep in mind that your website will organize your posts from newest post to oldest post based on the dates you give them. So, if you write a new blog post but give it a date far into the past, your site visitors may never see it since it will be sent to the back of the line.
