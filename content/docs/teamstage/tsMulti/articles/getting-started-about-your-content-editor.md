### How does it work?

Your *Content Editor* is a place where you can tell your site how you want things to be customized. You can change site colors, text, teams, pages and many other things all inside of here! This gives you one easy-to-use place to make your site exactly the way you want it to be.

### How do I use it?

Let's get to the fun part!

We made the Content Editor as simple to use as we could so you'll find things to be very intuitive. You can make edits to your site using forms similar to checking out on an e-commerce page or making edits to your Facebook page.

Once you make your desired changes, you will **always** want to make sure that you publish them by clicking the "Publish" button in the top right corner and clicking "Publish Now" in the dropdown menu. Two clicks and you're changes will be saved!

### Okay, but how do I make those changes show up on my page?

You're done! We'll do some magic behind the scenes and your changes will show up in approximately a minute and a half. If you ever make edits and they take longer than 15 minutes to show up, please [contact us](https://inthezone.dev/#contact-form) so we can investigate.
