### The Header Image

This is the big, beautiful image that shows up when a visitor first show up to your website. Used correctly, this image can take your visitor's breath away and give them an overall great impression of your web page. For this, reason, we recommend using a high quality action shot of one of your teams playing, a team photo, or something else that is really eye-catching.

### Header Image Text

You can add some text to show up on top of your image if you wish. Tell us about what makes your team great, write down the organizations motto, or add in some other worthwhile text that accentuates your header image.

If the color of your text and the color of your image aren't meshing well, feel free to [contact us](https://inthezone.dev/#contact-form) so that we can switch it up to get a better look.

### "Text Below Icons"
