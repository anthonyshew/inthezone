### Effective Title

The title that you place in this input will be shown on both the Home Page as the title of the image as well as the title of the Custom Page itself. Because of this, you will want to make sure that your title is focused and meaningful to the page itself.

### Eye-Catching Image

The better your image, the more professional your page will look. This image shows as both the icon on the Home Page and the banner image for your page so make sure it is high-resolution and well-framed.

### Informative Description

The description you give should be short but to the point. It will show as a sub-title on both your Home Page and your Custom Page. For this reason, you will want to make sure that your description is enlightening.

### Feature-Rich Body

The body of your page is made up of a Rich Text Editor. This makes it packed with features that allow you to truly create a page that can do a lot for you and your organization.

The best custom pages are long, full of useful information, and utilize images effectively.
