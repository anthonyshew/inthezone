The New York Knights were created with one goal in mind.

## Serving the youth baseball community through stewardship, good values, and the highest instruction possible for every age level.

As members of our local baseball community, we had grown a bit tired of what we saw. In our eyes, there was more that could be done to enrich the lives of the young baseball players that were paving the early roads to the rest of the career.

We wanted to do more.

Today, the New York Knights bring a never-say-die attitude to the field every time we take it. Attention to detail, individual effort, and mental toughness are hallmarks of Knights Baseball and an important part of everything we do - even off the field!

## Go Knights!
