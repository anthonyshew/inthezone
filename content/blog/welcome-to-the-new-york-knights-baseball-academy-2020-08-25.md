We have been chasing a facility for awhile now as our needs have gotten bigger and bigger.

## Welcome to the New York Knights Academy.

Featuring to batting tunnels, three mounds, a video game area, ping pong, a study room, and seating for the parents, our facility is second to none in the area. We will take a special amount of pride in using this facility to become the best travel ball team in the nation.

## We now offer private lessons, too.

For non-Knights players, we invite the public to come on in and work with the best coaches in the area just like our Knights players get to on the daily. Rates will vary based on demand but one thing will be clear: The young baseball player in your life will become a better ball player.
