## Game #1

In Game 1, the Knights took an early lead and never looked back. Carl McDonald threw and outstanding 4 innings and Jimmy Powers came in to close. The offense was led by Terry Louis who had three hits, including one triple and 5 RBIs. The Knights ended up winning the game 6-2.

## Game #2

Unfortunately, game #2 of the day looked a little tired on the Knights side of the ball. Finishing the game with a score of 3-4, the Knights fell to a strong club from out of state. The offense saw great success from the tail end of the order. The last three hitters combined to hit 6-for-7 with 3 of the team's RBIs.

## Game #3

Returning on Sunday, the Knights came up big in the morning to defeat some local rivals. In a true team effort, the Knights took Game #3 in mercy fashion after playing 4 long innings. The final score was 13-2.
