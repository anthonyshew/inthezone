* ## Cooperstown, January

  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you are looking at the Cooperstown Champions in the year 2019. We take a special amount of pride in this trophy as it such a storied and reputable tournament in youth travel ball in the United States.
* ## Hooverville, March

  Perhaps the largest local tournament in our area, the Knights came to earn runner-up honors at the Hooverville tournament. Our players showed us all what they were really made of during this tournament with several come from behind victories and some serious displays of heart.
* ## Big League Dreams, June

  Keep on rolling, Knights! The fellas won another tournament! On the backs of some strong pitching performances, the Knights hoisted another trophy - and in Yankee stadium!
* ## Marley Station, September

  Another unstoppable performance! However, this time the Knights showed up to swing it. Bashing a tournament record 14 home runs, the Knights steamrolled through this small local tournament to become the first team to ever win both the Hooverville and Marley Station Tournaments!

### See you in 2020!
